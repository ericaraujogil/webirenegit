                <p>I’m Irene Marcuello Gallardo an artist settled in Barcelona. I specialize myself in graphic design and UI.<br> 
<br>
I’m a design graduate with mention in visual creation in EINA, Barcelona. This background gave a stong toolset of visual development which allowed me to merge my knowledge with my passion, videogames.
Since then I’m keen on following my dream. 
<br><br>
I’ve completed a master in Art and animation for AAA videogames in the UPC (Universitat Politènica de Catalunya) and put myself through some projects and experiences to test myself.<br><br> 
Right now I’m looking somewhere to work. If you liked my projects, please feel free to download my CV to get more detail information.</p>
