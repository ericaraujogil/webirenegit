                <p class="findercontent">Develop a consistent  UI in less than 48h is a true challange. In this game jam I tried to focus myself into creating something with the resources that I had handy but yet still interesting.<br>
                    The result it's a playful interface that reinforces the technological aspect of the videogame and follows the cartoonish artstyle that we went for.
